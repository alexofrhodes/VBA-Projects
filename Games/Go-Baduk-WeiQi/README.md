Baduk (Korean), Go (Japanese) or WeiQi (Chinese).  

Invented in China more than 2,500 years ago. One of the four essential arts  of the cultured aristocratic scholars.  
It is considered the oldest board game continuously played to the present day, with over 46 million players worldwide.  
Despite its simple rules, Go is very complex, with large scope for play, long games and many alternatives per move.  
I first learned about it from popular manga Hikaru no Go.
